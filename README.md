# benday-azure-easyauth-sample

This repo contains sample code and hands-on labs for working with Azure App Service Security ("easy auth").  The code in the dotnet2.1 folder is the source code for a 5 part series of blog posts that wrote in 2018.

Here's [the source code for these blog posts](https://github.com/benday/benday-azure-easyauth-sample/tree/master/dotnet2.1/Benday.EasyAuthDemo). Each post is its own hands-on lab.  Here are [the PDF labs](https://github.com/benday/benday-azure-easyauth-sample/tree/master/labs/2018-version).

#### .NET Core 3.0

There's also sample code that targets .NET Core 3.0.  It's similar to the code from the labs but it's not exactly the same.  It also contains the beginning of some custom role-based security demos that were written for [VSLive Orlando 2019](https://www.vslive.com).

Here's the [.NET Core 3.0 sample code](https://github.com/benday/benday-azure-easyauth-sample/tree/master/dotnet3.0/Benday.EasyAuthDemo).
